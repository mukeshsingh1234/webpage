# webpage
A website build with HTML, JSP and MySQL as a backend Database

Export this Repo into your local system

pre-requisite:
Eclipse with Web Dev env
mysql jdbc connector
sql database (I have used mysql work bench and mysql server)
Tomcat server 8 or 9

Open this repo in eclipse
start tomcast server and run this repo on the same server and you wil be able to host this websie Locally

Some change would be required:
Changing the Mysql data base name and mysql address in RegistrationServelet.java and Login.java
These fiels you would find under webpage->Java Resources->src/main/java->com.uniquedeveloper.registration
